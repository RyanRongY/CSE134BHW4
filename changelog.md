#Part 1 improve Website 

1. I readjust the margins and padding to improve the spacing between elements in the css file. 
Now the topics of each sections are in the center of their paddings 
2. I rearranged the sequence of all my contents so that the visitors or users of this site will get to the important part first 
3. I added more inner links in the site so that the users don't have to all the way scroll down to see the content they need. 
4. I change the whole design of the contact form so that it fits better with the whole site. 
5. In the skills section I updated the newest skills I learnt in the past quarter and also  adjust the style for all the skill list items 

#Part 2 use 3rd party js 

As part of my portfolio site update, I added Google Analytics to my site to track visitor behavior and gain insights into how visitors are interacting with my site. I added the Google Analytics tracking code to the head section of my site's HTML code, as recommended by Google.

I chose to add Google Analytics to my site because it is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into website traffic and visitor behavior. By tracking metrics such as page views, bounce rates, and conversion rates, I can better understand how visitors are interacting with my site and identify areas where I can make improvements to optimize my site's performance.
